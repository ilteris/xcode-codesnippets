##Summary
Repository of code snippets for Xcode. Feel free to clone the repo to your directory of your choice. It sits on my `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets`. I use mattt's xcode-codesnippet's repo as a submodule so when I need something I quickly skim through it and add it to Xcode. If you have more more repos to suggest feel free.

Credits to @lukeredpath for the gem & @subdigital for sharing the knowledge.  https://gist.github.com/subdigital/4463440/download
